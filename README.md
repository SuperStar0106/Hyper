HyperUI is a free, open source library of Tailwind CSS components.

## How Does it Work? ðŸ¤”

It's simple!

Head to a collection you like, let's say [footers](https://hyperui.dev/collections/footers), from here you can view all the components at `sm`, `md` and `lg+` breakpoints.

If you find one you like, great! ðŸ¥³

Simply click the `ðŸ“‹ Copy` button and then paste the HTML in your project.
